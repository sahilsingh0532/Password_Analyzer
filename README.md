# Password_Analyzer
This project is a Password Analyzer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a real-time analysis of password strength based on several security criteria, helping users create stronger passwords for better protection.

# Features:
Real-Time Analysis: As users type their passwords, the analyzer evaluates the strength instantly.
Strength Meter: A visual strength meter (ranging from weak to strong) updates dynamically based on the entered password.
Criteria Evaluation: The analyzer checks for:
Password length
Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
Numbers
Special characters (e.g., @, #, $)
Password Suggestions: Provides feedback on how to improve password strength by suggesting missing elements.
Responsive Design: The interface is mobile-friendly, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
# Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structure and form elements.<br>
CSS3: Styling and layout, including animations for the strength meter.<br>
JavaScript: Core functionality for analyzing password input, displaying strength, and providing feedback.
# Usage:
Type a password into the input field.
Watch the real-time feedback as the analyzer evaluates the strength of the password.
Use the suggestions provided to improve password security.
Future Enhancements:
Adding password pattern checks (e.g., avoiding common patterns like '12345', 'password', etc.).
Implementing dark mode for improved user experience.
Integration with external libraries for password hashing or encryption.
